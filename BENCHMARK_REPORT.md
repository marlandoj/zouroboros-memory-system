## Graph-Boosted Search

| Test | v2.0 | v3.0 | Delta | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| ✓ Cluster query (FFB) — scoring overhead | 0.12ms | 1.07ms | +0.95ms | Hybrid retrieval: 28.55ms (shared). FTS: 12, Vector: 13 |
| ✓ Cluster query (FFB) — ranking change | top3=[choice,name,choice] | top3=[seo-audit,choice,choice] | Rankings changed (graph influence) | 10 facts graph-boosted, 0 neighbors injectable |
| ✓ Cluster query (memory) — scoring overhead | 0.02ms | 0.26ms | +0.24ms | Hybrid retrieval: 25.39ms (shared). FTS: 13, Vector: 7 |
| ✓ Cluster query (memory) — ranking change | top3=[database,choice,database] | top3=[gate,choice,database] | Rankings changed (graph influence) | 9 facts graph-boosted, 0 neighbors injectable |
| ✓ Cluster query (swarm) — scoring overhead | 0.01ms | 0.15ms | +0.14ms | Hybrid retrieval: 23.9ms (shared). FTS: 3, Vector: 3 |
| ✓ Cluster query (swarm) — ranking change | top3=[choice,executors,performance] | top3=[choice,performance,executors] | Rankings changed (graph influence) | 3 facts graph-boosted, 2 neighbors injectable |
| ✓ Orphan query (user prefs — no links) — scoring overhead | 0.01ms | 0.35ms | +0.34ms | Hybrid retrieval: 21.78ms (shared). FTS: 4, Vector: 2 |
| ✓ Orphan query (user prefs — no links) — ranking change | top3=[timezone,code_style,name] | top3=[timezone,code_style,name] | Rankings unchanged | 0 facts graph-boosted, 0 neighbors injectable |
| ✓ Cross-cluster query (memory→swarm) — scoring overhead | 0.02ms | 0.25ms | +0.23ms | Hybrid retrieval: 23.41ms (shared). FTS: 7, Vector: 7 |
| ✓ Cross-cluster query (memory→swarm) — ranking change | top3=[gate,choice,performance] | top3=[gate,choice,database] | Rankings changed (graph influence) | 7 facts graph-boosted, 0 neighbors injectable |

## Memory Gate Filtering

| Test | v2.0 | v3.0 | Delta | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| ⚠ Gate classification accuracy | N/A (always inject) | 66.7% (8/12) | 66.7% accuracy | Correct skips: 6, Correct memory: 2, False pos: 0, False neg: 4 |
| ✓ Gate latency per message | 0ms (no gate) | 1146ms avg | +1146ms per gated message | Trade-off: latency added but tokens saved |
| ✓ Token savings (12-msg sample) | 2400 tokens (always-on) | 400 tokens (gated) | 83.3% fewer tokens | Projected swarm savings: 6 of 12 messages filtered |
| ✓ Swarm token budget (11 tasks, 8K context) | 2200 tokens (27.5% of budget) | 800 tokens (10.0% of budget) | 63.6% reduction | Based on documented gate behavior: ~4 of 11 swarm tasks trigger memory injection |

## End-to-End Latency

| Test | v2.0 | v3.0 | Delta | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| ✓ E2E latency: "FFB hosting decision" | 31.9ms | 28.1ms | -3.8ms faster | Graph scoring + neighbor injection overhead |
| ✓ E2E latency: "memory system configuration" | 28.7ms | 35.0ms | +6.3ms overhead | Graph scoring + neighbor injection overhead |
| ✓ E2E latency: "user preferences" | 25.3ms | 24.8ms | -0.5ms faster | Graph scoring + neighbor injection overhead |
