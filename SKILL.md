# Zo Memory System Skill v4.0.0

Give your Zo personas persistent memory with semantic understanding, graph intelligence, and automatic fact capture.

**v4.0 Updates (Q2-Q4 2026):** Context budget awareness (token tracking + proactive checkpointing), recursive episode summarization (Ollama-powered FIFO compression), metrics dashboard (latency/recall/capture/gate stats), iterative multi-hop retrieval (confidence-based BFS with query refinement), cross-persona memory sharing (pools + inheritance hierarchy), conflict resolution (semantic/temporal detection + provenance tracking), enhanced knowledge graph (typed relations, cycle detection, DOT export, co-occurrence inference), embedding model benchmarking (3-model comparison + recall measurement).

**v3.2 Updates:** Procedural memory (versioned workflow patterns with Ollama-powered evolution), cognitive profiles (executor failure patterns + entity affinities), orchestrator integration (6-signal composite routing with procedure + temporal scoring, auto-episode creation after swarm runs)

**v3.1 Updates:** Episodic memory (event-based "what happened" with outcomes), temporal queries (since/until filtering), velocity trends, DB migration system, auto-capture episode hook

**v3.0 Updates:** Graph-boosted hybrid search (graph-boost.ts), BFS path finding & knowledge gap analysis (graph.ts), auto-capture pipeline for conversation-to-fact extraction (auto-capture.ts), co-capture linking, contradiction detection with supersession

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull required models
ollama pull nomic-embed-text   # Embeddings (768 dimensions)
ollama pull qwen2.5:1.5b       # HyDE query expansion + memory gate
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b         # Auto-capture fact extraction (optional)

# Start Ollama (if not running)
ollama serve &
```

### Model Selection

| Model | Purpose | Size | Why |
|-------|---------|------|-----|
| `nomic-embed-text` | Vector embeddings | 274 MB | Best open embedding model, 768d |
| `qwen2.5:1.5b` | HyDE expansion + gate | 986 MB | Fast generation, good quality for query rewriting |
| `qwen2.5:7b` | Auto-capture extraction | 4.4 GB | Reliable structured JSON extraction from transcripts |

**Note:** qwen2.5:7b is optional — auto-capture falls back to qwen2.5:3b if 7b is unavailable.

---

## Performance

| Mode | Latency | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **FTS + Vectors only** | ~0.5s | Specific queries with exact keywords |
| **With HyDE** | ~4s | Vague/conceptual queries (e.g., "that thing about data safety") |
| **Graph-boosted** | +~5ms | Adds graph scoring to any search (negligible overhead) |
| **Auto-capture** | ~3-5s | Per-conversation extraction (post-conversation, not per-turn) |

**HyDE Trade-off:** Adds ~3.5s but dramatically improves recall for vague queries (1 result → 6 results in testing).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize the database
cd /home/workspace/Skills/zo-memory-system
bun scripts/memory.ts init

# Add memory to a persona
bun scripts/add-persona.sh "my-persona" "Role description"

# Store a fact
bun scripts/memory.ts store \
  --entity "user" \
  --key "preference" \
  --value "value" \
  --decay permanent

# Search with semantic understanding + graph boost
bun scripts/memory.ts hybrid "why did we choose the database"

# Manage knowledge graph
bun scripts/graph.ts link --source <id1> --target <id2> --relation "depends_on"
bun scripts/graph.ts knowledge-gaps

# Auto-capture facts from a conversation
bun scripts/auto-capture.ts --input conversation.md --dry-run
```

---

## Commands

### Store Facts
```bash
bun scripts/memory.ts store \
  --persona shared \
  --entity "user" \
  --key "name" \
  --value "Alice" \
  --decay permanent \
  --category preference
```

### Search Memory

**Continuation Recall (facts + episodes + open loops):**
```bash
bun scripts/memory.ts continuation "where did we leave off on the health dashboard?"
bun scripts/memory.ts open-loops --status open
bun scripts/memory.ts resolve-loop "The dashboard issue is fixed now"
```

**Hybrid Search (semantic + exact + graph boost):**
```bash
bun scripts/memory.ts hybrid "database decision rationale"
bun scripts/memory.ts hybrid "why did we pick SQLite" --no-hyde  # Skip HyDE for speed
```

Hybrid search now includes graph-boosted scoring. When facts are linked via `fact_links`, linked results boost each other. Scoring weights:

| Signal | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| RRF (FTS + Vector) | 0.60 | Primary signal |
| Graph Boost | 0.15 | Reward associative proximity |
| Freshness | 0.15 | Recency bonus |
| Confidence | 0.10 | Trust signal |

When no graph links exist for any result, original weights (0.70/0.20/0.10) are preserved.

**Fast Exact Search (FTS5 only):**
```bash
bun scripts/memory.ts search "router password"
```

**Lookup by entity:**
```bash
bun scripts/memory.ts lookup --entity "user"
bun scripts/memory.ts lookup --entity "user" --key "name"
```

### Maintenance
```bash
# View statistics (shows embeddings count, model config)
bun scripts/memory.ts stats

# Check Ollama health and model availability
bun scripts/memory.ts health

# Backfill embeddings for all facts
bun scripts/memory.ts index

# Prune expired facts and orphaned embeddings
bun scripts/memory.ts prune

# Apply adaptive decay (demotes stale, promotes frequently-accessed)
bun scripts/memory.ts decay

# Consolidate duplicate facts (merge same entity+key entries)
bun scripts/memory.ts consolidate
```

---

## Knowledge Graph (graph.ts)

The graph CLI manages associative links between facts and provides graph analysis tools.

### Link Management

```bash
# Create a link between two facts
bun scripts/graph.ts link --source <id1> --target <id2> --relation "depends_on" --weight 0.8

# Remove a link
bun scripts/graph.ts unlink --source <id1> --target <id2>
bun scripts/graph.ts unlink --source <id1> --target <id2> --relation "depends_on"

# Show all links for an entity or fact
bun scripts/graph.ts show --entity "project.ffb-site"
bun scripts/graph.ts show --id <fact-id>
```

### Find Connections (BFS Path Finding)

Find the shortest path between two entities through the knowledge graph:

```bash
bun scripts/graph.ts find-connections --from "project.ffb-site" --to "system.zo"
bun scripts/graph.ts find-connections --from "user" --to "decision.hosting" --max-depth 3
```

Output:
```
Path found (2 hops):

  [project.ffb-site.name] "FFB website redesign project"
    -->depends_on
  [decision.hosting] "Decided to use Zo hosting"
    -->related
  [system.zo.infrastructure] "Zo Computer infrastructure setup"
```

### Knowledge Gaps Analysis

Scan all facts for maintenance opportunities:

```bash
bun scripts/graph.ts knowledge-gaps
```

Output:
```
Knowledge Gap Analysis
======================
Total facts: 73
Linked facts: 14 (19.2%)
Orphan facts: 59 (80.8%)

Dead ends (targets only, never source):
  - [decision.hosting] "Decided to use Zo hosting" (2 inbound, 0 outbound)

Weakly linked (only 1 connection):
  - [project.ffb-api] "FFB API integration" (1 link)

Connected components: 3
  Cluster 1 (8 facts): hub = [project.ffb-site] (5 links)
  Cluster 2 (4 facts): hub = [system.zo-infrastructure] (3 links)
  Cluster 3 (2 facts): hub = [decision.memory-cli] (1 link)

Suggested: 12 orphan facts share entities with linked facts and could be connected.
```

---

## Auto-Capture (auto-capture.ts)

Extract structured facts from conversation transcripts automatically.

### How it works

1. Transcript is sent to qwen2.5:7b (or 3b fallback) for structured extraction
2. Each candidate fact is quality-filtered (confidence >= 0.6, value >= 10 chars)
3. Dedup check against existing facts (hash-based exact match)
4. Contradiction detection: same entity+key with different value creates a `supersedes` link
5. Passing facts are stored with embeddings and auto-linked as `co-captured`

### Usage

```bash
# Preview extraction (dry-run, no storage)
bun scripts/auto-capture.ts --input conversation.md --dry-run

# Extract and store
bun scripts/auto-capture.ts --input conversation.md --source "chat:2026-03-04"

# Pipe from swarm output
cat swarm-output.md | bun scripts/auto-capture.ts --source "swarm:ffb"

# View capture history
bun scripts/auto-capture.ts stats
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--input <file>` | Transcript file path | stdin |
| `--source <label>` | Source label for audit trail | "cli" |
| `--persona <name>` | Persona to store facts under | "shared" |
| `--dry-run` | Show extraction without storing | false |
| `--model <name>` | Override extraction model | qwen2.5:7b |

### Quality Safeguards

- **Confidence threshold**: Facts below 0.6 confidence are discarded
- **Value length minimum**: Facts with values shorter than 10 chars are discarded
- **Max 20 facts** per capture (prevents runaway extraction from long transcripts)
- **Transcript hash** prevents re-processing the same content
- **Dry-run mode** for testing extraction quality before committing
- **Source tagging** for audit trail (`source: "auto-capture:{label}"`)

### Contradiction Handling

When auto-capture finds an existing fact with the same entity+key but a different value:
1. New fact is stored normally
2. A `supersedes` link is created: new_fact → old_fact
3. Old fact's confidence is halved (soft deprecation, not deletion)

### Co-Capture Linking

Facts extracted from the same conversation are automatically linked with `relation: "co-captured"` and `weight: 0.5`. This seeds the knowledge graph with organic connections.

---

## Conversation Capture (conversation-capture.ts)

Extends memory capture beyond swarm tasks to **all conversations**. Scans workspace artifact directories (`/home/.z/workspaces/con_*/`) for reports, analysis outputs, and tool results, then runs them through the auto-capture extraction pipeline.

```bash
# List all capturable artifacts
bun scripts/conversation-capture.ts --list

# Process all new artifacts
bun scripts/conversation-capture.ts

# Only last 24 hours
bun scripts/conversation-capture.ts --since 24h

# Preview without storing
bun scripts/conversation-capture.ts --dry-run

# Show capture statistics
bun scripts/conversation-capture.ts --stats
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--since <duration>` | Filter by recency: 1h, 24h, 7d, 30d, 1w, 1m | all |
| `--dry-run` | Show extraction without storing | false |
| `--list` | List capturable files with status | — |
| `--stats` | Show conversation capture statistics | — |

### Filters

- Skips files < 200 bytes or > 500 KB
- Skips `read_webpage/`, `browser_agent/`, `node_modules/`, `venv/` directories
- Only processes `.md`, `.txt`, `.json` files
- Hash-based dedup via `capture_log` table (never re-processes same content)
- Creates episodes for each capture session

### Scheduled Agent

A daily agent runs at 04:00 AM Phoenix time, executing conversation-capture for the last 24 hours and emailing a maintenance report with fact counts, DB stats, and any errors.

---

## Episodic Memory (v3.1)

Episodic memory captures "what happened" as events with outcomes — complementing facts (what is true) with episodes (what occurred).

### Database Migration

Before using episodic memory, run the migration to add the new tables:

```bash
bun scripts/memory.ts migrate
```

This is idempotent (safe to run multiple times) and preserves all existing data.

### Querying Episodes

```bash
# List all episodes
bun scripts/memory.ts episodes

# Filter by time
bun scripts/memory.ts episodes --since "7 days ago"
bun scripts/memory.ts episodes --since "2026-03-01" --until "2026-03-07"
bun scripts/memory.ts episodes --since "last week"

# Filter by outcome
bun scripts/memory.ts episodes --outcome failure
bun scripts/memory.ts episodes --outcome success --since "30 days ago"

# Filter by entity
bun scripts/memory.ts episodes --entity "executor.claude-code"
bun scripts/memory.ts episodes --entity "project.ffb-site" --since "7 days ago"
```

### Velocity Trends

Track success/failure rates over time for any entity:

```bash
# Weekly trends (default)
bun scripts/memory.ts trends --entity "executor.claude-code"

# Daily granularity
bun scripts/memory.ts trends --entity "project.ffb-site" --granularity day

# Monthly, last 6 months
bun scripts/memory.ts trends --entity "swarm.ffb" --granularity month --since "180 days ago"
```

Output:
```
Velocity trends for "executor.claude-code" (by week):

  Period        Total  OK  Fail  Rate
  ─────────────────────────────────────
  2026-W06          1   1     0  100%
  2026-W09          1   0     0  0%
```

### Time Formats

The temporal query system accepts:
- **Relative:** "7 days ago", "30 minutes ago", "2 weeks ago", "3 months ago"
- **Named:** "today", "yesterday", "last week", "last month", "last year"
- **ISO dates:** "2026-03-01"
- **Unix timestamps:** raw seconds

### Auto-Capture Episode Hook

When auto-capture stores facts from a conversation, it automatically creates an episode recording the capture event. This means every auto-capture run becomes a queryable event in your episodic timeline.

---

## Procedural Memory (v3.2)

Procedural memory captures reusable workflow patterns as versioned step sequences. Procedures track success/failure rates and can self-evolve using Ollama when failures accumulate.

### Managing Procedures

```bash
# List all procedures (shows latest version per name)
bun scripts/memory.ts procedures --list

# Show steps for a specific procedure
bun scripts/memory.ts procedures --show "site-review"

# Record feedback after running a procedure
bun scripts/memory.ts procedures --feedback <procedure-id> --success
bun scripts/memory.ts procedures --feedback <procedure-id> --failure

# Force Ollama-powered evolution based on failure episodes
bun scripts/memory.ts procedures --evolve "site-review"
```

### Procedure Evolution

When a procedure accumulates failures, `--evolve` uses Ollama (qwen2.5:7b) to analyze linked failure episodes and suggest improved steps. The evolved procedure:
- Gets a new version number (v1 -> v2)
- Links to its parent via `evolved_from`
- Starts with fresh success/failure counts
- May adjust timeouts, add fallback executors, or reorder steps

### Cognitive Profiles

Executor history (`~/.swarm/executor-history.json`) is extended with cognitive fields:
- **`recent_episode_ids`** — Last 10 episode IDs for "why did this happen?" queries
- **`failure_patterns`** — Auto-classified error types (timeout, mutation_failed, file_not_found, permission_denied)
- **`entity_affinities`** — Per-entity success rates as exponential moving averages

These fields are backward compatible — old history files parse correctly without them.

### Orchestrator Integration (v4.5)

The swarm orchestrator (`orchestrate-v4.ts`) now:
1. **Creates episodes** — Every swarm run auto-creates an episode with outcome, duration, executor list, and task tags
2. **6-signal composite routing** — Adds `procedureScore` (from procedure success rates) and `temporalScore` (from recent episodic performance) to the existing 4-signal composite router
3. **Cognitive data on outcomes** — Success/failure calls pass error types and entity affinities to executor history

---

## MCP Server (v3.3.1)

Expose the memory system as MCP tools for Claude Desktop, Cursor, Gemini, Codex, and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Transport Modes

| Mode | Script | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|

---

## Memory Gate (Always-On Context Injection)

The memory gate (`scripts/memory-gate.ts`) uses a local Ollama model to classify incoming messages and decide whether memory context should be injected. It now prioritizes likely continuation-style turns first, using blended continuation recall before falling back to the standard memory search path.

### How it works

1. User sends a message
2. Continuation detector checks for likely follow-on work
3. If continuation-like: blended recall searches facts + episodes + open loops from the last 14 days
4. Otherwise the gate model (qwen2.5:1.5b) classifies whether stored memory is needed
5. If no: message passes through with zero overhead
6. If yes: gate extracts keywords, runs hybrid search, injects results as context

### Usage

```bash
# Direct invocation
bun scripts/memory-gate.ts "what did we decide about FFB pricing?"
# Exit 0 + results printed

bun scripts/memory-gate.ts "hello"
# Exit 2 (no memory needed, no output)

bun scripts/memory-gate.ts "update the supplier scorecard"
# Exit 0 + results printed (or exit 3 if no results found)
```

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Memory results found and printed |
| 1 | Error (Ollama down, parse failure) |
| 2 | No memory needed (greeting, general knowledge, self-contained request) |
| 3 | Memory needed but no results found |

### Zo rule integration

Create an always-applied Zo rule that runs the gate on every message:

```
Run: bun /home/workspace/Skills/zo-memory-system/scripts/memory-gate.ts "<message>"
- Exit 0: inject stdout as background context
- Exit 2: skip (no memory needed)
- Exit 3: skip (no results)
```

### Configuration

```bash
export ZO_GATE_MODEL="qwen2.5:1.5b"  # Default gate model
export OLLAMA_URL="http://localhost:11434"
```

The gate uses `keep_alive: "24h"` to keep the model loaded in memory. A daily scheduled agent should ping the model to prevent cold starts (~35-58s on first load vs ~5-7s warm).

### Performance in multi-agent swarms

The gate is what makes this memory system viable for swarm workflows. Without gating, always-on injection consumes 34-120% of an 8K context budget across 11 tasks. With gating, only ~4 of 11 tasks get memory injection, keeping consumption at 2.5-6.9%.

| Metric | With gate | Without gate (always-on) |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Tasks injected | ~4 of 11 | All 11 |
| Memory tokens per swarm run | 800-2,200 | 12,100-38,500 |
| % of 8K context budget | 2.5-6.9% | 34-120% |

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 4.0.0 | 2026-03-29 | Context budget awareness (token tracking + proactive checkpointing), recursive episode summarization (Ollama-powered FIFO compression), metrics dashboard (latency/recall/capture/gate stats), iterative multi-hop retrieval (confidence-based BFS with query refinement), cross-persona memory sharing (pools + inheritance hierarchy), conflict resolution (semantic/temporal detection + provenance tracking), enhanced knowledge graph (typed relations, cycle detection, DOT export, co-occurrence inference), embedding model benchmarking (3-model comparison + recall measurement). |
| 3.3.1 | 2026-03-07 | HTTP MCP server (`mcp-server-http.ts`) — Streamable HTTP transport via Bun.serve(), registered as Zo hosted service (`svc_PXkgBzRdH8M`), HTTPS at `zo-memory-mcp-marlandoj.zocomputer.io`, configured in Claude Code / Gemini / Codex / workspace .mcp.json, bridge script updated with zo-memory tool permissions |
| 3.3.0 | 2026-03-07 | Conversation capture (conversation-capture.ts) — scan all workspace artifacts for fact extraction, not just swarm. Scheduled daily agent for automatic capture + maintenance reports. Memory Manager persona with full CLI access. |
| 3.2.0 | 2026-03-07 | Procedural memory (versioned workflow storage, CRUD, feedback, Ollama evolution), cognitive profiles (episode IDs, failure patterns, entity affinities in executor-history.json), orchestrator v4.5 integration (auto-episode on swarm completion, 6-signal composite routing with procedure + temporal scores), MCP server (5 tools: search, store, episodes, procedures, cognitive_profile), import pipeline (ChatGPT, Obsidian, markdown), enhanced CLI (profile, import, mcp commands) |
| 3.1.0 | 2026-03-07 | Episodic memory (episodes table, entity tagging, temporal queries), velocity trends, DB migration system (migrate/rollback), auto-capture episode hook, stats v3 with episode/procedure counts |
| 3.0.0 | 2026-03-04 | Graph-boosted hybrid search (graph-boost.ts), BFS path finding & knowledge gap analysis (graph.ts), auto-capture pipeline (auto-capture.ts), co-capture linking, contradiction detection, scoring redistribution (RRF 0.60 + Graph 0.15 + Freshness 0.15 + Confidence 0.10) |
| 2.3.0 | 2026-03-03 | Memory gate (memory-gate.ts), always-on context injection via Zo rules, 24h model keep-alive, gate-filtered token savings for swarm workflows |
| 2.2.0 | 2026-02-27 | Ollama health check, fetch timeouts, prune/decay/consolidate/link/graph commands, vector pre-filtering, adaptive decay, associative routing, PRAGMA busy_timeout |
| 2.1.0 | 2026-02-22 | Parallelized HyDE/FTS/embedding execution, optimized for qwen2.5:1.5b, performance docs |
| 2.0.0 | 2026-02-19 | Hybrid SQLite + Vector search, HyDE query expansion, semantic retrieval, nomic-embed-text via Ollama |
| 1.1.0 | 2026-02-18 | Added swarm v4 integration documentation |
| 1.0.0 | 2026-02-08 | Initial release - SQLite persona memory, 5-tier decay, FTS5 search |
